# Neighbourhood Helper (MERN Stack)

## 1. Project Overview

Users can:

- Browser help requests
- Offer help
- Ask for help
- Register and login
- Edit and delete help requests
- Cancel own offers
- Reject help offers from other users

## 4. Data Structure (MongoDB & Mongoose)

#### 4.1. User Collection (to store user information)

```js
{
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true},
  firstName: { type: String, required: true },
  lastName: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  zipCode: {
    type: String,
    enum: [
      "04177 Lindenau, Alt-Lindenau, Neu-Lindenau",
      "04178 B√∂hlitz-Ehrenberg, R√ºckmarsdorf, Burghausen",
      "04179 Leutzsch", ],
    required: true },
  requests: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Request" }],
  offers: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Offer" }],
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
}
```

#### 4.2. Request Collection (to store help requests information)

```js
{
  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }, // Who posted it
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  category: { type: String,  enum: ["Errands", "Groceries", "Transport", "Household Help", "Pet Care", "Childcare", "Tutoring", "Tech Support", "Moving Help", ], default: "Errands" },
  when: { type: String, required }, // "Today", "Second week of May", "June 15, from 9 to 11 am"
  status: { type: String, enum: ["open", "helped"], default: "open" },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
}
```

Note: Zip Code is already set when user registers.

#### 4.3. Offer Collection (to store help offers information)

```js
{
  requestId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Request" },
  helperId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }, // Who offered help
  message: { type: String, required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
}
```

## 5. Backend API Design (Express & MongoDB)

#### 5.1. User Routes (`/users`)

| Method | Endpoint    | Description                                            | Logged in User? |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| POST   | `/register` | Create a new user                                      | ‚ùå No           |
| POST   | `/login`    | Authenticate user & return JWT token                   | ‚ùå No           |
| GET    | `/logout`   | Log out user                                           | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| GET    | `/data`     | Fetch logged-in user data                              | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/update`   | Update user data                                       | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/delete`   | Delete user account and all related offers & requests. | ‚úÖ Yes          |

#### How will the frontend use these?

- The register & login pages will use `/register` and `/login`.
- The frontend will store the JWT token in localStorage or cookies to authenticate the user.
- After login, the app will use `GET /data` to show the logged-in user's profile or dashboard, and to keep user logged in after refreshing page.

#### 5.2. Requests Routes (`/requests`)

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                            | Logged in User? |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| GET    | `/`               | Display all requests on homepage       | ‚ùå No           |
| GET    | `/:id`            | View details of a specific request     | ‚ùå No           |
| GET    | `/my-requests`    | Fetch all requests from logged-in user | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| POST   | `/`               | Create a new help request              | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/:id`            | Request creator edits their request    | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/:id`            | Request creator deletes their request  | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| ‚ùì GET | `/?zipCode=04177` | Filter requests by zip code            | ‚ùå No           |

#### How will the frontend use these?

- The homepage (`GET /requests`) will display all requests.
- The request card (`GET /requests/:id`) will show details of a specific request.
- The create request page/modal (`POST /requests`) will let users add a new request.
- The user dashboard (`GET /requests?zipCode=04177`) will filter requests for the user's neighbourhood.
- The edit request page (`PUT /requests/:id`) will allow modifying a request.
- A delete button (`DELETE /requests/:id`) will let users remove their request.

#### 5.3. Offers Routes (`/offers`)

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                             | Logged in User? |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| GET    | `/my-offers`       | Fetch all offers from logged-in user    | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| POST   | `/:requestId`      | Post an offer on a request              | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| GET    | `/:requestId`      | Fetch all offers for a specific request | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/cancel/:offerId` | User cancels own offers                 | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/reject/:offerId` | User rejects offers from other users    | ‚úÖ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/:offerId`        | Offer owner edits their offer           | ‚úÖ Yes          |

#### How will the frontend use these?

- On a request card, users will see a button "Offer Help" ‚Üí This calls `POST /offers/:requestId`.
- The request owner can see who offered help ‚Üí This uses `GET /offers/:requestId`.
- If a user wants to refuse a help offer, they will use `DELETE /offers/:offerId`.
